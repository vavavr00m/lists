| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| ⬜️ Coded , Cipher , Crypto | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/004.a.htm) | The numbers are replaced by letters; the same letters stand for the same numbers; different letters for different numbers. The assignment of the numbers to the letters can be found out. | [ Grant Fikes ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Toroid , Toroidal | None | The upper and lower as well as the left and right edges of the diagram are stitched together; the diagram therefore resembles the surface of a tire. | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Hexagonal | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/020.a.htm) | The diagram is a hexagonal grid; a lamp shines in all six possible directions; the numbers in the black fields indicate how many lamps are on the six neighboring fields; | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Mirror | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/003.a.htm) | In addition to the black fields, there are one-sided and two-sided diagonal mirrors on which a light beam is reflected by 90 °.

| ⬜️ Queens | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/022.a.htm) | The lamps not only shine horizontally and vertically, but also diagonally. The numbers in the black fields indicate how many lamps are on the eight neighboring fields (the four orthogonal and the four diagonal). | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Ex | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/002.a.htm) | In addition to standard black fields with standard numbers, there are other black fields in which the number indicates how many sides of the black field are illuminated by lamps | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |

#### アルコネ / Arukone Variants ([Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone/index.htm))
| Title | Link | Description | Author | [✝️+A 🇺🇸] | [✝️+A 🇯🇵] |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| ⬜️ Arukone² | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone-2/index.htm) | Has one additional rule compared to Arukone: "All fields must be used by lines".<br /><br />If you look at the Arukone puzzles, you can see that Arukone always uses all fields of lines. This is due to the fact that puzzles with empty spaces usually have several solutions. [The requirement that a task have only one solution is an unwritten convention in the puzzle scene.]<br /><br />This has led many puzzle authors to add the sentence "All fields must be used by lines" in the set of rules, mistakenly assuming that this only helps the solvers and does not otherwise change anything. But this is not true: If a puzzle author designs a puzzle and has this additional rule in mind, then the character of Arukone can change fundamentally.<br /><br />[The problem with Arukone is to find any crossing-free lines between the pairs of numbers. With Arukone² it can be very easy to find such lines, with some or many fields remaining empty. The challenge then is to artificially lengthen the lines so that all fields are used. This can lead to a completely different alignment than the first approach.] | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Arukone³ | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone-3/index.htm) | has another additional rule that is borrowed from Nurikabe: "A line must not cover a 2x2 area." Arukone changes this additional rule so seriously that one can actually speak of an independent type of puzzle. New solution techniques are added; others no longer work. | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Turning Points | None | There must be a line through each field. Between two numbers N, the path has to bend exactly N times by 90 °. | [ Thomas Snyder , No. 92] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Arukone + Masyu | None | Some fields contain white or black circles. A line must run through all circular fields. In a field with a white circle, the line must not turn; in a space with a black circle it must turn. | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
<br />

#### バッグ / Corral Variants ([Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Corral/index.htm))

| ⬜️ Toriod , Toroidal , Torus | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/072.a.htm) | The upper and lower edge as well as the left and right edge of the diagram are stitched together; the diagram therefore resembles the surface of a tire. | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Terraces | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/073.a.htm) | Two circular routes must be drawn in the diagram, one of which must be completely contained in the other. | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Columns , crates | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/071.a.htm) | Some fields contain columns within the circular path that block the view. | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Diagonal | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/074.a.htm) | The numbers indicate the visibility of the diagonal fields, not that of the orthogonal fields. | [ Prasanna Seshadri ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Multiplicative | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/075.a.htm) | A number indicates the product of the horizontally visible fields and the vertically visible fields within the circular route. | [ Grant Fikes ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Multiplicative Antisymmetric | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/076.a.htm) | Of every two numbers arranged point-symmetrically, one is additive, the other multiplicative. | [ Brian Chen ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ✅ Inside-outside, inside-out | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/077.a.htm) | Some numbers are inside the circular route, some outside. Numbers outside the circular route indicate how many fields you can see in total outside the circular route if you look to N, S, E and W from the number field. | [ Thomas Snyder ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
<br />

| ⬜️ Heyawacky | None | The original rules only provide for rectangular areas; at Heyawacky, the areas can be shaped as desired. Since there are no other rule changes, Heyawacky is integrated into Heyawake. | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ AYE-Heya (∀ 人 ∃ＨＥＹＡ) or "human" (人) | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/AYE-Heya/index.htm) | The black fields must be arranged symmetrically in each area with respect to the center of the area. The strange name plays with the mathematical symbols "for everyone" ( ∀ ) and "it exists" ( ∃ ) as well as the Kanji for "human" (人): "There is a room for every human being". | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Symmetry | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/041.a.htm) | Some areas do not contain numbers but one of the letters A or S. In S areas, the black fields must be arranged symmetrically with respect to the center of the area; In A areas, the black squares must not be arranged symmetrically with respect to the center of the area. | [ Grant Fikes ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Numberless | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/005.a.htm) | An arrow between two areas points from the area with fewer black cells to the area with more black cells. | [ Anuraag Sahay ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Twins | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/042.a.htm) | Each black field adjacent orthogonal with exactly one other black box; the black fields form dominoes. | [ Bram de Laat ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Pentomino | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/043.a.htm) | There are no territorial boundaries. The area boundaries can be found by dividing the diagram into exactly 12 different pentominoes, whereby each pentomino must contain exactly one field with a number (or a question mark). | [ Palmer Mebane ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Surveyor | None | Some areas contain multiple numbers. Exactly one of them is a heyawake number (that is, indicates how many fields are black in the area), the others indicate. how many of the 3x3 = 9 fields with the number field as the center are black. | [ Chaos in the Sky, No. 8 ] | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
| ⬜️ Sleep | [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Varianten/088.a.htm) | A star in a field indicates that exactly one orthogonal neighboring field is white and all other orthogonal neighboring fields are black. | ❎ | [RQT'D] | [RQT'D] |
