* アルコネ / Arukone Variants ([Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone/index.htm))

| - | - | - | - |
| <ul><li>- [ ] Arukone² </li></ul>| [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone-2/index.htm) | Has one additional rule compared to Arukone: "All fields must be used by lines". <br /> If you look at the Arukone puzzles, you can see that Arukone always uses all fields of lines. This is due to the fact that puzzles with empty spaces usually have several solutions. [The requirement that a task have only one solution is an unwritten convention in the puzzle scene.] <br /> This has led many puzzle authors to add the sentence "All fields must be used by lines" in the set of rules, mistakenly assuming that this only helps the solvers and does not otherwise change anything. But this is not true: If a puzzle author designs a puzzle and has this additional rule in mind, then the character of Arukone can change fundamentally. & [The problem with Arukone is to find any crossing-free lines between the pairs of numbers. With Arukone² it can be very easy to find such lines, with some or many fields remaining empty. The challenge then is to artificially lengthen the lines so that all fields are used. This can lead to a completely different alignment than the first approach.] | Not cited |
| <ul><li>- [ ] Arukone³ </li></ul>| [Janko](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone-3/index.htm) | has another additional rule that is borrowed from Nurikabe: "A line must not cover a 2x2 area." Arukone changes this additional rule so seriously that one can actually speak of an independent type of puzzle. New solution techniques are added; others no longer work. | Not cited |
| <ul><li>- [ ] Turning Points </li></ul>| None | There must be a line through each field. Between two numbers N, the path has to bend exactly N times by 90 °. | [ Thomas Snyder , No. 92] |
| <ul><li>- [ ] Arukone + Masyu </li></ul>| None | Some fields contain white or black circles. A line must run through all circular fields. In a field with a white circle, the line must not turn; in a space with a black circle it must turn. | Not cited |
