Abasiophilia # attraction to people in neck braces, wheelchairs, casts, or other devices that impair mobility that was documented for the first time as occurring in a woman in the late 80s [[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J056v03n02_11)]. It may be part of a medical fetish or enjoyed because it restricts movement.
Abduction as seduction # a kink where the abductor/kidnapper treats the victim in a loving manner.
Abrasions # people who enjoy this fetish like giving or receiving cuts and scrapes.
Acarophilia # arousal from scratching. Scratching is often an element incorporated into rough sex.
Accidental stimulation # refers to accidental physical stimulation and situations that arouse adrenaline and cause arousal.
Acrotomophilia # fetish for amputees [[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01101829)]. Fetishists may prefer a specific type of amputee (arm, leg, etc). A person with a fetish for being an amputee has apotemnophilia. There may be overlap with morphophilia.
Actirasty # arousal by the rays of the sun. This may be enjoyed through sex outside.
Agalmatophilia # a person with this fetish is aroused by statues, mannequins or other figurative representations. This may be related to Pygmalionism, an attraction to items of one‚Äôs own creation.
Age play # role play in which one or both partners pretends to be a different age/stage. Types of age play include infantilism, Daddy/daughter play, and diaper play, among others. Some kinksters differentiate between DD/lg and age play.
Agoraphilia # fetish dedicated to sex in public places.
Aliens # kinksters fetishize about having sex with aliens, often in an abduction and forced scenario.
Altocalciphilia # a fetish for high heels, usually worn by women but not always.
Amazons and authoritarians # fetish dedicated to physically strong women like Amazons, women with strong personalities, or women in positions of authority.
Amaurophilia # kink for being unable to see, blinded or blindfolded during sex.
Anal penetration # a fetish for anal penetration with foreign objects (not sex toys or penises). Inserting objects that are not designed for anal safety (porous, without a flared base, with sharp edges) can cause damage.
Anal sex # both giving and receiving anal sex can be a kink or fetish. Giving to a male with a strap-on is also known as pegging.
Anal toys worn under clothing # a fetish for using/wearing anal toys such as butt plugs during the day and not just during sex activity. It may be a command of a submissive by a dominant, part of anal training to take bigger items or penises and/or as part of foreplay.
Anal training # the practice of preparing one‚Äôs anus for inserting large items.
Anasteemaphilia # a fetish for people over extreme sizes, ie a giant or a dwarf. It can be used to refer to attraction to partners of differing heights even if those people aren‚Äôt especially gigantic or tiny.
Anonymous sex # a kink revolving around anonymous sexual encounters where one or both parties is unaware of the other‚Äôs identity. Gloryholes are a common form of anonymous sex but they are not the only form.
Aquaphilia # fetish for water and having sex in or around water.  This can extend to a fetish for swimwear or posing in water even if it doesn‚Äôt involve sexual activity.
Asphyxiation # a highly danerous kink dedicated to choking, smothering and strangulation. Autoerotic asphyxiation is self-choking. To be clear, asphyxiation is very dangerous and has led to injuries and deaths [[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23596893)] [[4](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237809)] [[5](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563678)] [[6](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10581915)]. See also breath play.
Autogynephilia # a kink where men present/dress as women (gynemimetophilia refers to men impersonating women). Autoandrophilia is arousal at the idea of being a man. Note that this term was coined as an improvement on cross-dressing kink and has been used to describe transgendered individuals and has been used as an argument that trans people are mentally ill. Many prefer not to use this term, which is often transphobic. However, some people may have a fetish for crossdressing or becoming another gender that does not relate to their gender identity.
Autofellatio # a kink where a man performs a blowjob on himself.
Autoplushophilia # a type of plushophilia where a person is aroused by the idea being a stuffed animal, especially a cartoonish one [[7](https://web.archive.org/web/20200930090545/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19308843)].
Barebacking # sex without a condom. Barebacking is especially common in the gay community, but this act can be dangerous and lead to STI transmission or pregnancy.
Bathroom control # when the dominant person controls when, how and where the submissive can urinate or defecate. Extreme bathroom control can be dangerous.
Begging # kink for begging and pleading (to have sex, for release/orgasm, to perform an act, etc.). Begging is submissive in nature.
Belonephilia # affinity to pins, needles and sharp objects. Belonephilia can be quite dangerous. See also knife play.
Bestiality # sex with animals.
Bimbofication # The process of making someone into a bimbo or being turned into a bimbo themselves.
Blindfolds # a type of bondage that blocks a person‚Äôs vision. See also amaurophilia.
Body Inflation # The practice of inflating or pretending to inflate a part of one‚Äôs body, often for sexual gratification.
Bondage # restraint of a person, either by physical item (cuffs, rope, etc.) or instruction (known as mental bondage). Restraint can be full-body (vacuum beds, suspension) or involve a single body part such as the eyes (blindfold), mouth (ball gag), wrists or even thumbs. Bondage may include furniture and devices. Reddit has a number of subreddits dedicated to the subject.
Body modification # kink for a variety of body modifications. This may mean anything that changes the appearance of a body from tattoos to piercings to saline injections, but this kink may also only refer to specific body mods such as lip sewing.
Branding # marking someone with a symbol, word, etc. Typically uses a heated object (such as a metal hanger) to produce the brand. Branding is dangerous.
Breath play # choking and limiting breath.  Being aroused by this is known as hypoxyphilia  This kink is a type of edge play that is dangerous.
Breast/nipple torture # the breast equivalent of CBT. Torture may include hitting, pinching, bondage, and other methods of inflicting pain onto breasts.
Breast/nipple worship # the act of worshipshipping someone‚Äôs breasts or nipples.
Caning # the act of hitting someone with a rod known as caning.  Fleshy areas such as the back of the thighs and butt are advised, but some people enjoy caning the bottoms of feet. Canes are traditionally made from wood, but modern canes may be made from plastic, metal or other semi-flexible materials. Caning is a form of impact play that is more extreme than typical flogging and may be dangerous if done improperly.
Castration # An extreme fetish involving removal of all or part of a man‚Äôs genitals. Actual castration is incredibly dangerous. Most kinksters obsess over it without actually going through with it. This kink goes hand in hand with emasculation fetishes as well as the ball busting, in which a man‚Äôs balls are crushed.
CBT # Cock and ball torture (CBT) is pain applied to a man‚Äôs genitals. It may be a form of punishment. CBT can involve shoes, sounding, stretching, impact implements and other tools. CBT can be dangerous.
Chasmophilia # aroused by crevices, caverns, or valleys.
Chastity # a fetish where someone‚Äôs access to their genitals is blocked. Women wear chastity belts, and men wear cock cages that prevent erection and release. Also known as forced abstinence or forced celibacy. Chastity can be used as a form of self-denial or orgasm control.
Choking # blood choking is the act of choking someone until they pass out. It is incredibly dangerous and can lead to brain damage. Choking is a type of edge play:
Claustrophilia # this fetish is the opposite of claustrophobia. A person becomes aroused or experiences orgasm through confinement to small spaces. This is a type of bondage.
Clothed sex (endytophilia) # the affinity for sex while fully or partially clothed. You can enjoy this kink while lifting your skirt or dress, so your man penetrates you. Pushing underwear to the side can also be a form of this fetish.
Cock and/or ball fetishization # an obsession with cock and balls.
Cock worship # similar to breast worship. This fetish involves verbal, physical and mental adoration of a penis ‚Äì including fake ones (strap-ons).
Collaring # the act of wearing a collar to show submission, loyalty and/or devotion to a dominant. A collar may be seen as purely sexual or also romantic (similar to an engagement/wedding ring).
